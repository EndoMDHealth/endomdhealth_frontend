              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">Warning About Sending Health Images Via Text or Email</h2>
              <p>
                EndoMD Health intends to provide high-quality pediatric care accessible via short message service or SMS text. In some instances, you may seek care for your child's specific physical condition. While we invite you to share information that is relevant to EndoMD Health's provision of care, please do not send photos of the private reproductive areas of your child's body to us via SMS text or email. We understand that the photos may be relevant to your child's condition, but we do not want photos of your children's private reproductive areas falling into the wrong hands. In addition, some network providers have algorithms in place to detect child obscenity sent through SMS text or email; we do not want a well-intentioned photo to trigger an investigation for child pornography (for us or you). We strongly encourage you to discuss the condition with an EndoMD Health professional before sending any photos and then only send photos as requested by the EndoMD Health professional.
              </p>
